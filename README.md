# PowerShell Toolkit

A comprehensive collection of PowerShell scripts for system administration, network management, security, development, and automation tasks.

## Overview

This toolkit provides a set of powerful PowerShell scripts designed to help IT professionals, system administrators, developers, and power users automate common tasks and improve productivity. Each script is well-documented with detailed help information, examples, and parameter descriptions.

## Categories

### System Administration

Scripts for managing and monitoring Windows systems.

- **[Get-SystemInfo.ps1](System-Administration/Get-SystemInfo.ps1)**: Retrieves comprehensive system information from local or remote computers, including hardware, operating system, installed software, and network configuration.

### Network Management

Scripts for network scanning, monitoring, and configuration.

- **[Scan-Network.ps1](Network-Management/Scan-Network.ps1)**: Scans a network range for active hosts and open ports, providing detailed information about discovered devices.

### Security

Scripts for password management, security auditing, and hardening.

- **[Password-Manager.ps1](Security/Password-Manager.ps1)**: A secure password generator and manager that can create strong passwords and securely store them using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI).

### Development Tools

Scripts to assist with software development tasks.

- **[Generate-Code.ps1](Development-Tools/Generate-Code.ps1)**: Generates code templates and boilerplate for different programming languages and frameworks, saving time when starting new projects.

### Automation

Scripts for task scheduling and process automation.

- **[Schedule-Tasks.ps1](Automation/Schedule-Tasks.ps1)**: Simplifies the creation and management of scheduled tasks on Windows systems, providing an easy-to-use interface for common scheduling operations.

## Usage

Each script includes detailed help information that can be accessed using the PowerShell `Get-Help` cmdlet:

```powershell
Get-Help .\Script-Name.ps1 -Full
```

Most scripts also include examples in their header comments that demonstrate common usage scenarios.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016/2019/2022
- Administrator privileges for some operations

## Testing

This repository includes a comprehensive testing framework using **Pester** to ensure all scripts work correctly and maintain high code quality.

### Quick Start Testing

```powershell
# Run all tests
.\RunTests.ps1

# Run with detailed output
.\RunTests.ps1 -ShowDetails

# Run in CI mode with coverage
.\RunTests.ps1 -TestType All -OutputFormat NUnitXml -CI

# Run only unit tests
.\RunTests.ps1 -TestType Unit

# Run only integration tests
.\RunTests.ps1 -TestType Integration
```

### Test Framework Features

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual script components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows and cross-script functionality
- **Code Coverage**: Maintains 80%+ test coverage across all scripts
- **Security Analysis**: Automated security scanning with PSScriptAnalyzer
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing on every commit and pull request
- **Performance Testing**: Validates script execution time and resource usage

### Test Results

The testing framework generates comprehensive reports:
- **Console Output**: Real-time test results
- **NUnit XML**: For CI/CD integration
